Using the ping Command
The ping command is used to send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts.

It's a useful tool for checking network connectivity and diagnosing network issues.

The ping command has options to change how it works:

-c - Send a specific number of ping requests
-i - Wait a specific number of seconds between sending each packet
-t - Set the IP Time to Live (TTL)
-q - Quiet output, only show summary
-s - Specify the number of data bytes to be sent
